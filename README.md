# humhub2civicrm

**humhub2civicrm** is a connector module that synchronizes HumHub profile fields with CiviCRM groups. The Extended Contact Matcher must be installed on CiviCRM ([https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm)).

This module supports flexible newsletter and opt-in scenarios by linking HumHub checkboxes or profile values to CiviCRM group membership‚Äîfully automated on profile save.

---
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This module is in early development. While group joining and leaving functionality is working, logging is currently minimal and not yet user-friendly. The connection test is basic, profile field handling is limited, and matcher configuration is currently hardcoded. A dedicated log viewer and admin tools are planned.

## üßπ Features

- üîÅ **Auto-Sync on Profile Save**  
  Whenever a HumHub user updates their profile, an API call to Extended Contact Matcher (XCM) in CiviCRM is made - Fields that are send to CiviCRM can be configured.

- üì¨ **Newsletter/Opt-in Mapping**  
  Profile fields (e.g., checkboxes like `receiveNewsletter`) can be mapped to CiviCRM group joins/leaves. Supports "double opt-in" logic via separate `groupJoin` and `groupLeave`.

- üîß **Flexible Admin Configuration**  
  Easily configure CiviCRM API credentials and field-to-group mappings via a backend settings form.

- üîó **CiviCRM Matcher Integration**  
  Currently uses [`xcm_profile=HumHubMatcher`](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm) to match or create contacts in CiviCRM.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. On profile update (`onProfileUpdate`), the module sends the users profil Information to CiviCRM (`Contact.getorcreate`). A suitable matching profile must be configured.
2. If successful, it retrieves or creates a contact.
3. For each configured profile field:
   - If the field value is truthy ‚Üí the contact is **added** to `groupJoin`
   - If the field is falsy ‚Üí the contact is **removed** from `groupLeave`

This lets you implement opt-in/out flows for newsletters, campaigns, or interest-based tagging in CiviCRM.

## üîß Configuration

Available under **Admin Panel ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí humhub2civicrm ‚Üí Settings**

- `apiUrl`: Full REST endpoint of your CiviCRM installation (e.g. `https://example.org/civicrm/ajax/rest`)
- `apiKey`: CiviCRM API key of the user account
- `siteKey`: CiviCRM site key (global config)
- `newsletters`: JSON-configurable mappings between HumHub profile fields and CiviCRM group actions.

### Example Configuration

| field            | groupJoin | groupLeave | description                     |
|------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------------------|
| `receiveUpdates` | `102`     | `103`      | Different groups for opt-in/out |
| `eventOptIn`     | `201`     | `202`      | Different groups for opt-in/out |
| `specialNotice`  | `301`     | `301`      | Same group for join/leave       |

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- A working [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) installation
- The [de.systopia.xcm](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.xcm) extension installed and enabled in CiviCRM

---
## üîç Debugging / Logs

All API activity (calls, errors, group actions) is logged in two places:

- **Module-specific log file**: Located in `@runtime/logs/humhub2civicrm.log`. This includes API calls, contact sync details, payload data, and group updates.
- **HumHub's general log (`app.log`)**: Only critical errors and warnings are sent here to avoid clutter.

The payload sent to CiviCRM is logged as JSON for easy inspection. If a contact update fails, CiviCRM responses are also logged in full.

A dedicated admin-facing log viewer is planned for a future version.

## üß™ Connection Test

In the module settings, you can run a connection test to verify that your CiviCRM API credentials are working.  
Enhanced user feedback is planned.
